                <h2 style="color: #8B1E3F; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">A Divided Response</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.9; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    Societal reaction to the Scientific Revolution was a mixture of acceptance, skepticism, and 
                    conflict, as people increasingly questioned traditional authority, religious doctrines, and 
                    long-established knowledge. Many individuals, especially educated elites, embraced the new 
                    emphasis on human reason, logic, and empirical evidence, which encouraged a more critical 
                    way of thinking and helped lay the groundwork for the Enlightenment and later the Industrial 
                    Revolution. However, these changes were not universally welcomed. Powerful institutions, 
                    particularly the Catholic Church, resisted ideas that threatened their authority or contradicted 
                    religious teachings, leading to open conflict between science and religion. This tension is 
                    clearly illustrated by the persecution of Galileo, whose support for heliocentrism challenged 
                    the Church's geocentric worldview and highlighted the broader struggle between emerging scientific 
                    ideas and traditional beliefs.

                        <h3>Acceptance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Educated elites, philosophers, and forward-thinking scholars embraced the new scientific 
                            ideas. They saw the power of empirical evidence and mathematical reasoning as tools for 
                            understanding the natural world. This acceptance fostered intellectual communities and 
                            scientific societies that promoted collaboration and knowledge sharing.

                        <h3>Skepticism</h3>
                        <p>
                            Many people remained cautious about revolutionary scientific claims that contradicted 
                            centuries of accepted wisdom. Conservative scholars questioned whether observation alone 
                            could overturn traditional knowledge. This skepticism demanded stronger evidence and 
                            more rigorous proof before accepting new theories.

                        <h3>Conflict</h3>
                        <p>
                            Religious and political authorities actively resisted scientific ideas that threatened 
                            their power and doctrines. The Church condemned heliocentrism as heresy, banned books, 
                            and persecuted scientists. This conflict between faith and reason defined the era and 
                            tested the courage of truth-seekers.

                <h2 style="color: #8B1E3F; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Institutional Resistance</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.9; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The Catholic Church viewed many scientific discoveries as direct challenges to its authority 
                    and interpretation of Scripture. The geocentric model, which placed Earth at the center of 
                    God's creation, had been church doctrine for centuries. When Copernicus and later Galileo 
                    proposed a heliocentric model, it wasn't merely a scientific dispute�it threatened the Church's 
                    cosmological and theological framework.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.9; text-align: justify;">
                    Church officials feared that if scientific observation could overturn biblical interpretation 
                    in astronomy, it might undermine religious authority in other areas as well. This led to the 
                    establishment of the Index of Forbidden Books, formal condemnations of heliocentric theory, 
                    and the prosecution of scientists who promoted ideas deemed heretical.

                        Galileo Galilei's persecution stands as the most dramatic example of the conflict between 
                        scientific inquiry and religious authority during the Scientific Revolution. In 1633, Galileo 
                        was summoned before the Roman Inquisition to answer charges of heresy for his support of 
                        Copernican heliocentrism, which he had promoted in his book <em>Dialogue Concerning the Two 
                        Chief World Systems</em> (1632).

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
                        The Inquisition accused Galileo of violating a 1616 injunction that had warned him not to 
                        teach or defend heliocentrism. The Church viewed his support for the idea that Earth moves 
                        around the Sun as contrary to Holy Scripture, particularly passages that described the Sun 
                        as moving across the sky. Galileo argued that Scripture should be interpreted in light of 
                        scientific evidence, but the Church rejected this approach.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
                        Under threat of torture and execution, Galileo was forced to recant his support for 
                        heliocentrism and declare that he had erred in defending it. He was sentenced to house 
                        arrest for the remainder of his life and his book was banned. The trial sent a chilling 
                        message to other scientists: challenging church doctrine could result in severe punishment. 
                        Despite his forced recantation, Galileo continued his scientific work under house arrest, 
                        writing his final masterwork on physics and motion.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
                        Galileo's trial became a symbol of the struggle between scientific truth and institutional 
                        authority. It illustrated the broader tension of the era: how could society reconcile new 
                        empirical discoveries with long-held religious beliefs? The case demonstrated that the path 
                        to scientific progress would require not just intellectual courage, but also the willingness 
                        to face persecution for pursuing truth. In 1992, more than 350 years later, the Catholic 
                        Church formally acknowledged its error in condemning Galileo.

                <h2 style="color: #8B1E3F; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Broader Struggle</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.9; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Galileo's persecution was not an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern of resistance 
                    to scientific ideas. Other scientists faced similar challenges: Copernicus delayed publishing 
                    his heliocentric theory until near death, fearing backlash. Giordano Bruno was burned at the 
                    stake in 1600 for his cosmological views. Ren� Descartes suppressed some of his own works to 
                    avoid controversy.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.9; text-align: justify;">
                    Yet despite this resistance, scientific ideas continued to spread. The printing press allowed 
                    scientific works to circulate beyond the Church's control. Universities gradually incorporated 
                    new scientific methods. Philosophical movements like rationalism and empiricism gained followers. 
                    The very conflict between science and authority helped crystallize the importance of intellectual 
                    freedom and the pursuit of truth based on evidence rather than tradition.

                <h2 style="color: #8B1E3F; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Gradual Acceptance</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.9; text-align: justify;">
                    Over time, the weight of empirical evidence became impossible to ignore. As telescopes improved 
                    and observations multiplied, the heliocentric model proved increasingly accurate in predicting 
                    planetary positions. Newton's mathematical laws unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics, 
                    providing a comprehensive framework that was both elegant and powerful. Even religious thinkers 
                    began to argue that understanding God's creation through science glorified the Creator rather 
                    than undermined faith. By the early 18th century, the Scientific Revolution's major ideas had 
                    gained widespread acceptance among educated Europeans, though the process had taken generations 
                    and required tremendous courage from those who championed scientific truth.
